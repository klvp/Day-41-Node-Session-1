Node JS:  Its a place where we can run JavaScript or 
	  Run time environment to run JavaScript on OS

We have browsers to run JavaScript then Why we need Node JS ?
Browser can not create, delete, update files stored in PC since browsers have restriction
so we introduced Node JS

Browser cannot
1)access file system
2)access hardware details
3)copy files
4)delete files

Virus
Love Virus in 2000
Worm Virus

Node JS can do

1)data streaming (Twitch)
2)server side proxy
3)bigdata and analytics
4)wireless connectivity
5)web Scraping
6)REST API



JavaScript Fundamentals :

1) JS is single threaded language and asyncronous


callback : when an event completes another action taken

callback function : a function that can be used as an argument in another function and it will be executed after event completes

action : event to be completed 
reaction : callback function execution

All event handlers are asynchronous

Event Loop : http://latentflip.com/

Event loop pushes things from queue to Stack

Event loop is a guy who continuously checks Is call stack empty ? and when call stack is empty then it 
will push code which are in Callback queue

Call Stack (also called as main thread) :  JavaScript only runs here (synchronous code run here)
Web API : 
1)Browser related function like setTimeout and setInterval and animations 
2)Web API know only to wait until promise completes
3)all waiting things comes under Web API
Callback Queue : things pushed here after waiting in Web API



NODE JS:

Node JS has global variable called "process" and argv will store command line variables

Node JS does not have browser global variable like window, document but it has "global" global variable
